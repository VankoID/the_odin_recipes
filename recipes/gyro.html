    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A Gyro is a Greek sandwich traditionally made using lamb, beef, or pork combined with tomato, onion, and a yogurt sauce on pita bread. In Greece, Gyros are popular street food. A proper gyro is made with meat that is cooked on a slowly-rotating, vertical spit in front of an upright rotisserie.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb. chicken breast</li>
        <li>3 tbsp. olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tbsp. lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 tbsp. red wine vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tsp. paprika</li>
        <li>1 tsp. dried oregano</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the chicken in a medium bowl and add all of the marinade ingredients. Mix it well, cover with plastic wrap, and marinate for at least 2 hours, preferably overnight.</li>
        <li>Grate the cucumber and squeeze the excess liquid out with your hands. Discard the liquid. Place the cucumber in a mixing bowl with the rest of the tzatziki ingredients and mix well.</li>
        <li>Heat a large, non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken slices and cook for about 4-5 minutes on each side, until cooked through. Slice the chicken into thin strips.</li>
        <li>Warm the pita bread (in the oven or microwave). Add a bit of shredded lettuce, tomato, cucumber, onion, and chicken on top. Drizzle with a generous amount of tzatziki and feta cheese, if desired. </li>
    </ol>
